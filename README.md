# iOS Web App Configuration Profiles
Utilizing Apples configuration profiles for iOS, you can make any website a isolated PWA (Progressive Web App).

Use cases: 
1. Stay logged into the same website across different accounts (isolated site data + cookies)
2. Create web apps for websites that don't natively support it.
3. Avoid built in application tracking by using javascript tracker blockers like [AdGuard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162)
